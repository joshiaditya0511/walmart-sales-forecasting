# Walmart Sales Forecasting

Welcome to my analysis of Walmart store weekly sales! This project explores various aspects of sales data to uncover patterns and insights. The analysis is based on a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rutuspatel/walmart-dataset-retail).

## Project Overview

This project includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in the data.
- **Forecasting:** Building predictive models to forecast future sales using advanced techniques.

> **Note:** You can explore the full project on the [project website](https://walmart.adityajoshi.in)

> **Caution:** The data used in this project is for academic purposes only.


## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements and additional analyses include:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Holiday Flags:**
   - Analyze sales trends before and after holidays.
   - Validate the impact of holiday flags on sales.
   - Quantify the influence of specific holidays on sales.
   - Investigate store-specific holiday effects.
   - Detect anomalies using the Darts library.

2. **Seasonal Trends:**
   - Explore advanced smoothing techniques to better capture seasonal patterns.
   - Use methods like FFT, alternative decomposition, or refined anomaly detection.

3. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Validate correlations between:
     - Weekly sales and CPI.
     - CPI, unemployment, and fuel price.

### Forecasting
1. **Holiday Anomalies:**
   - Incorporate holiday effects into forecasting models using the Darts library.
2. **Residual Analysis:**
   - Perform residual analysis using the Ljung-Box test.
3. **Additional Metrics:**
   - Introduce complementary loss metrics to evaluate model performance.
4. **SHAP Analysis:**
   - Use SHAP to interpret model predictions.
5. **Alternative Techniques:**
   - Experiment with STL and MSTL forecasting methods for improved accuracy.

*This section will be updated as progress is made on these tasks.*
