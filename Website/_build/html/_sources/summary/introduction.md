# Introduction

Retail businesses thrive on understanding their sales patterns. Knowing how much product will sell in the coming weeks allows stores to optimize their marketing efforts and resource allocation. This report dives into the weekly sales data of Walmart's retail stores to uncover trends and predict future sales. By analyzing factors like holidays, temperature, fuel prices, and economic indicators, I aim to provide insights that can help the retailer make smarter decisions about managing their stores. This analysis uses a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rutuspatel/walmart-dataset-retail)
